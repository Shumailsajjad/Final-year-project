# Final year project (ongoing) (updated after every significant outcome/step)

###### The goal of this project is to determine how political elites in Pakistan use social media as a source to amplify their narratives and agendas using Misinformation. I have used the Twitter API to extract tweets of 30 prominent politicians belonging to the following two political parties, i.e., Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Muslim League N (PMLN). These tweets (Twitter data) have been extracted in the period spanning from 01/May/2022 (5:00 am UTC) to 23/August/2022 (11:00 pm UTC). A sample of two such politiciansâ€™ tweets has been shared (Imran Khan - Founder and Leader of PTI, and Shehbaz Sharif - Leader of the PMLN party).  

###### Once these tweets are collected, I have sampled the tweets into three categories (top 10%, average 10%, and bottom 10%) based on twitter engagement rates. Those tweets are saved as an output excel file for each politician. To verify the veracity of the tweets in these three categories, I have initially checked these tweets manually using local fact checking sources. The reason for this exhaustive process was to get a labeled data set. 

###### The project aims to determine which political party is more involved in spreading fake news based on URLs, Retweets, and tweets. These results will hopefully be transformed into a published paper by the end of my senior year.
